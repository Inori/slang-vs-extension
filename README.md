# The Slang Shading Language Visual Studio Extension

This is an unofficial Visual Studio extension for the Slang shading language.

It uses slang LSP service to provide slang language support, such as code completion and function signature help etc.

The syntax highlight theme is taken from the [official vscode extension](https://github.com/shader-slang/slang-vscode-extension) directly.

## Usage

To use the extension, make sure the folder of `slangd.exe` is in your environment `PATH`,
you can download it from the [official release page](https://github.com/shader-slang/slang/releases).
